I didn't see a way to make mouse controls work in 3D so the controls are:

press x/y/z to move on transform on that axis.
use up or right to increase the value and down or left to decrease the value

press r/t/s to switch to rotate/translate/scale mode.

Press a to add an object, you can add as many as you want, but be warned my laptop got quite slow if I just left a window open with around 8-10 objects in it.
Also the more objects you have in the scene the faster the transformations seem to be.
NOTE: when you add more than 3 objects rotation does seem to become 'un-uniform'.

I would recomend testing on the y axis as it seems to be the easiest to visualize. It goes almost straight up in the positive direction, while the positive x axis goes diagonaly down and right and the positive z axis goes diagonally down and left
